The amount of depth you guys go into and the minutiae that are discussed is, at times, mind-blowing. I think with how you guys pair up and openly express your opinions, sometimes taking one route and then going back to take a different route has so much value."

It was lots of work but Caio and Mike made me love to code and now I'm really passionate and love my work. I'm so happy to have bought this program. I'll always be grateful to you. Keep going, you help so many people!"

I used to hate writing unit tests because I never found someone who could prove to me why it really mattered. Now I can't imagine myself creating a project without using TDD. I really think all developers (even from other platforms) should watch their course. Of course, it's for iOS developers, but there is so much content about architecture and best practices. I find myself watching and rewatching the lectures over and over again."

Watching Caio and Mike develop an appâ€”and clearly explaining not only 'how', but 'why' they are doing thingsâ€”makes learning some challenging concepts clear. I've learned how to truly separate code into different modules and to test parts of an app that I had never been able to figure out before. I've gone through the whole course at least twice (with some sections more than that), and every run-through reveals more compelling insights I had previously missed."
