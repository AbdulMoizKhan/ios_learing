A key component of this framework is the ATTrackingManager class, which grants users control over how apps track their data for advertising purposes. This article explores the functionalities of ATTrackingManager, its impact on app developers and users, and a specific challenge encountered in iOS versions 17.4.0 and 17.4.1."
